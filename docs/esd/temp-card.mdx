### Overview

The **Temporary Cards** page allows administrators to manage temporary cards for short-term access, which can be used in the ESD module when the punch-in method is **Face recognition + ID card + ESD** or **ID card + ESD**.

**Note:** Temporary cards are primarily intended for visitors or short-term members who need to comply with ESD testing requirements.
