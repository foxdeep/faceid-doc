### Overview

The **Teams** page allows administrators to create and manage different groups within the OWL FaceID system. Each team has a unique **ID**, a **name**, and can optionally include **Virtual Teams**.

> **Note:** Virtual Teams are optional and allow administrators to categorize members within the main team for better organization. However, members are always associated with the main team.

### Status Icons

Each team has a **Status** indicator that represents the state of its face recognition model:

- **😊 (Smile Icon)** – The training model of the team is in good condition and does not require re-training.
- **☹️ (Sad Icon)** – The model needs re-training to improve accuracy.

### Steps to Create a Team

1. Navigate to **Settings > Teams**.
2. Click the **red "+" button** in the bottom-right corner.
3. Enter the **Team Name**.
4. Save the team; it will appear in the list with a unique **ID**.

### Managing a Team

- Click the **three-dot menu** next to a team to access the following options:
  - **Virtual teams**: Manage the virtual teams associated with the main team.
  - **Edit**: Modify the team name.
  - **Delete**: Remove a team (this action is irreversible).
