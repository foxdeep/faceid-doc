## OWL FaceID Cloud Service Basics

OWL FaceID Cloud Service has a streamlined process for face recognition. Here are the main features:

1. **Team Creation**: Users can set up separate teams for different groups or organizations.
2. **Member Management**: Each team has members whose face data is stored for identification.
3. **Face Recognition Model Training**: The system creates and updates recognition models based on face pictures uploaded by users.
4. **Model Testing**: Users can check how well the trained models work with new face images.
5. **Buddy License Activation**: Devices like phones or tablets need a Buddy License to access the service.

## OWL FaceID Terms

Knowing these terms will make using the system easier:

- **Team**: A group for face identification, like a company or a class.
- **Member**: An individual in a team who has a face picture in the system.
- **UID (Unique Identifier)**: A unique code for each member in a team.
- **Buddy License**: A digital certificate that lets a device use OWL FaceID services. Itâ€™s needed for EasyClockIn integration.
