### Overview

The Dashboard is your go-to center for tracking attendance, offering:

- **Total active teams** – This shows how many teams are currently active in the system.
- **Expired Buddy Licenses** – Indicates the number of buddy licenses that need renewal.
- **Binding Buddies** – Provides a list of buddies connected to specific devices, along with their online or offline status.
- **Today’s Attendance Status** – Gives a visual overview of check-ins and check-outs throughout the day.
- **Latest Punch-in Record** – Displays the most recent clock-in and clock-out timestamps, along with the associated UIDs and buddy information.

With this information, you can easily track attendance trends, spot any missing check-ins, and ensure adherence to attendance policies.
